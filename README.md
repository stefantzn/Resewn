# Resewn

Resewn is a platform which allows customers to buy and donate secondhand clothes. We will partner with sustainable clothing brands in order to upcycle our products which are then sold on our platform or recycled another way, leading to 100% recycled products.

## Tools Used
This project was created using React on the front end and Flask on the backend.

Our program also uses pretrained AI models from `sentence-transformers` in order to match user style preferences to our existing products by using word embeddings.
